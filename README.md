# Useful SwiftUI Extensions

This is a repository of useful SwiftUI extensions

## Color

In the file 'Color+Ext.swift' I have a few extensions that I use to create colors in SwiftUI.
Very useful is the possibility to create colors from the RGB hex format, as found in CSS. 
SwiftUI is a declarative language and it is well adapted to create content like webpages. 
I like to use a color picker, get the hex value of colors that I like and use them in my apps.
Example of usage:

``` swift
Color(hex: "FA1859")
```
